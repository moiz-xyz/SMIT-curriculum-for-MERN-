1. CRA (Create React App)
What It Is: Create React App is a tool for setting up a new React project with a default configuration. It abstracts away most of the configuration needed for a React app (e.g., Webpack, Babel).
Topics It Includes:
Setting up a project
Development server
Hot-reloading
Optimized production build
2. Vite
What It Is: Vite is a modern build tool that provides fast development server startup and optimized builds for production. It's often seen as an alternative to CRA.
Topics It Includes:
Fast server startup
Native ESM (ECMAScript Modules) support
Build optimization (e.g., code-splitting)
Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
3. React Icons
What It Is: React Icons is a library for using popular icon sets like Font Awesome, Material Icons, and others directly in React components.
Topics It Includes:
Importing and using icons as React components
Customizing icon styles (size, color, etc.)
Integrating with other UI libraries
4. React Router DOM
What It Is: React Router is a standard routing library for React. It allows you to handle navigation (e.g., switching between pages) in single-page applications (SPAs).
Topics It Includes:
Setting up routes with <Route /> and <Switch />
Creating links with <Link /> and <NavLink />
Nested routes and dynamic routing
Route protection (e.g., private routes)
5. Context API
What It Is: The Context API is a feature of React that allows for global state management in React apps, making it easier to pass data through the component tree without prop drilling.
Topics It Includes:
Creating and using context with createContext()
Providing and consuming context with <Provider /> and useContext()
Managing global state and side effects
6. Redux
What It Is: Redux is a state management library that helps you manage the state of your application in a predictable way.
Topics It Includes:
Actions, reducers, and stores
Dispatching actions and updating state
Redux middleware (e.g., Redux Thunk for async actions)
Connecting Redux with React using connect() or useSelector() and useDispatch()
7. TanStack Query (formerly React Query)
What It Is: TanStack Query is a data-fetching and caching library that simplifies working with remote data in React apps.
Topics It Includes:
Fetching data with useQuery()
Mutating data with useMutation()
Caching and background refetching
Pagination and infinite scrolling
Error handling and retries
8. Ahooks
What It Is: Ahooks is a collection of high-quality React hooks that help with state management, effects, and other common tasks.
Topics It Includes:
Custom hooks for use cases like debouncing, fetching, and more
Performance optimization hooks
Reusable logic for common tasks
